# Call for Speakers
With advances in AI, it is claimed that the results of search across all of digitized knowledge can be digested, summarized, and focused for any inquirer. If this is true, has the problem that IR set out to address now been solved?  Is there no need for improvements in search or recommendation -- the systems will tell us what ought to want to know. This workshop asks: is there a place for the guiding principles of IR, in this brave new world? What are the new questions, and can we find a path to answers, by extending the ideas that have brought us here? Do we need new ideas altogether?
We are looking for speakers to present their views and positions about the future of search. 
Topics of interest may include, but are not limited to:

- Does IR even matter anymore?
- Does the R in IR stand for retrieval or recommendation?
- Will people ever need to use a search engine in the future?
- What is the duty/responsibility of an IR system?
- Do we need to review papers, or can we just use LLMs to assess the work?
- Do we need to write papers, if LLMs can just generate them?
- If I want to see more, should the system give it to me?
- How can we trust IR systems if they make up everything?
- How environmentally responsible are the IR systems we are making?
- Is IR helping overcome the digital divide?
- Is IR addressing the disparity in information access, especially in marginalized communities?
- Should IR systems curate information for users to avoid information overload?
- What is the future of results presentation?
- Can IR further optimize workplace productivity?


If you are interested in presenting your views, submit an abstract only (approx. one page / up to 600 words along with any links to references) directly into our EasyChair <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=searchfuturesecir24">Link</a>.
